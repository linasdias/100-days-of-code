# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 28, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Planned the blog and started the base with the Minima theme.

**Thoughts** Minima is nice and very customizable. That might help me with learning how to deal with Ruby-based websites such as the one I'm currently working with at my internship.
